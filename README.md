This is fork of original repo with better error handling for users with Vive Wireless.

In this fix was added auto restart of SRanipal process. So when you change power banks of vive wireless this module will continue working and you don't need to manually kill process of both SRanipal and VRCFT and restart them.

Installation:
1. Download dll file from release section.
2. Replace old file in directory C:\Users\<YOUR_USER_NAME>\AppData\Roaming\VRCFaceTracking\CustomLibs\74f18332-1bcf-4b55-832d-9c91069afa31\SRanipalExtTrackingModule.dll with downloaded one
